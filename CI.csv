Title,Description
Normalised Difference Index (NDI),This method has the aim of segment plant material from soil background.
Excess Green Index (ExG),Another method is the one that indicates the colour vegetation.
Excess Red Index (ExR),This method is less accurate than ExG.
Colour Index of Vegetation Extraction (CIVE),This method was proposed to separate green plants from soil background in order to evaluate the crop growing status.
Excess Green minus Excess Red Index (ExGR),These methods were applied simultaneously to separate plants from the soil and residue.
Normalised Greenâ€“Red Difference Index (NGRDI),The method of NGRDI was used to overcome the differences in exposure settings selected by the digital camera when acquiring aerial photography of the field.
Vegetative Index (VEG),The study was conducted under field conditions and the image was captured by a CCD camera.
Modified Excess Green Index (MExG),The proposed method successfully converted the colour image into greyscale image which was very easy to binarise with a fast automatic threshold method.
Combined Indices1 (COM1),Combination of ExG CIVE ExGR and VEG index.
Combined Indices2 (COM2),The contribution of each selected method is controlled by a weighting factor with the weights summing one ExG CIVE and VEG index combined.
